# Proposed Framework for Reengineering Saudi Governmental and Banking Platforms via EOSIO Blockchain


---

## Executive Summary

This study proposes a strategic framework for reengineering the digital governmental and banking infrastructure in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, based on blockchain technology—specifically EOSIO—with the aim of establishing a unified sovereign digital ecosystem that reshapes the relationship between citizens, the state, and the economy.

The core vision of the project lies in unifying all government platforms—such as Absher, Tawakkalna, Etimad, National Access, and others—into a single intelligent conversational interface similar to ChatGPT, referred to as the “Digital Gateway of the State.” This interface allows any citizen or resident to complete all governmental, financial, commercial, and educational procedures through a unified language interaction, without needing multiple accounts or advanced technical knowledge.

EOSIO was selected as the technological foundation due to its open-source blockchain structure, which operates independently of the public EOS coin network and supports the creation of licensed, high-performance, and sovereign-configurable private networks. EOSIO features include:

Block production every 0.5 seconds.

Adjustable block size to expand capacity when needed.

An advanced permission system that enables recovery of lost keys and assignment of secondary keys.

High throughput performance capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, while maintaining security and transparency.


One of the most notable proposed outcomes of this framework is a sovereign digital payment system that surpasses traditional networks like Visa and "Mada" by offering:

Account information is never exposed to the recipient, preventing card data from being sold on the dark web.

Transactions are executed in less than one second.

All movements are recorded on a tamper-proof decentralized ledger.

No need for physical cards or external devices, minimizing fraud and hacking risks.


The study also suggests transforming the role of commercial banks into developers of decentralized lending and insurance algorithms (DeFi) under central bank supervision, reducing intermediary costs and enhancing financial service quality.

The proposed model merges governmental, financial, and commercial systems into a single blockchain-based platform, allowing this infrastructure to be exported as a sovereign digital product to countries lacking effective digital government frameworks—especially across the Arab world, Africa, and Asia. It could even serve as a comprehensive alternative to mBridge and global financial networks, due to its full traceability and flexibility in aligning with host nations’ sovereign policies. If globally adopted as a standard, it could eliminate financial fraud entirely, as all transactions would be traceable on immutable records.

This framework could also trigger an unprecedented transformation in international trade, shipping, and customs systems, turning the state into a fully integrated export platform representing 100% of its officially registered products—surpassing even platforms like Alibaba in terms of reliability and comprehensiveness. This would be achieved by directly linking commercial registries, customs authorities, and shipping agencies through automatically executed smart contracts, enabling:

> Automated pre-clearance of goods.

Real-time supply chain tracking.

Elimination of fraud and counterfeiting.

Reduced time and cost in global trade.




The study asserts that Saudi Arabia possesses the institutional capacity and executive experience necessary to export this model globally, especially given the lack of comprehensive digital solutions even in major powers like the U.S. and China. The system could be offered to other nations for free in exchange for a small percentage of the GDP growth derived from improved digital governance—making it a high-impact, low-cost global development model. Expected annual returns may exceed $10.5 billion.

The model is also expected to witness exponential adoption by other nations, as it meets the highest standards of digital governance while providing the most user-friendly experience ever through a unified conversational interface. Since the system would be available as an open-source project on GitHub.com, developers and governments worldwide could adopt, customize, and deploy it quickly, potentially triggering a global shift in governance, trade, and finance systems.

The project thus offers a new vision of the modern state as a "State-as-a-Platform," integrating governmental services with financial and commercial infrastructure into a transparent, scalable, and inherently secure system—qualifying it as a global alternative to existing trade and financial systems such as mBridge, Visa, and SWIFT.

## 1.1 Study Background

Over the past two decades, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has undergone a comprehensive digital transformation that has extended to most governmental and banking sectors. This transformation is evident in the development and launch of centralized digital platforms such as Absher, Etimad, and the Unified National Access system, alongside advanced banking systems operated by commercial and private banks.

Despite the significant improvements these initiatives have brought in facilitating service delivery and speeding up procedures, challenges remain. These include system fragmentation, inconsistent technical architectures, lack of structural integration, and frequent outages caused by periodic updates. These issues highlight the limitations of the current centralized model and expose vulnerabilities in the digital infrastructure when faced with growing cybersecurity threats—such as breaches, fraud, and unauthorized modification or forgery of financial and administrative records.

In this context, the need emerges for a comprehensive reengineering of governmental and banking platforms, based on a unified, flexible, and secure infrastructure. This should ensure uninterrupted operation, minimize the potential for errors or fraud, and ultimately aim to establish a banking system in which financial fraud is reduced to zero. This study presents a practical framework to achieve this transformation through the adoption of blockchain technology—specifically the EOSIO protocol—known for its high performance, flexible structure, and ability to execute distributed transactions reliably and in real time, without requiring system downtime for updates or expansion.

## 1.2 Importance of Transitioning to Blockchain

Transitioning to a blockchain-based infrastructure represents a fundamental shift in the way data and digital governmental and banking services are managed. In particular, the EOSIO technology stands out as a leading candidate capable of meeting the demands of modern governance due to its advantages over traditional centralized systems. These include continuous, uninterrupted operation, seamless update capabilities without affecting active processes, and full transparency in transaction recording—significantly reducing the potential for manipulation or forgery.

Moreover, the decentralized nature of blockchain increases the system’s resilience against cyberattacks and enhances user trust in the digital services provided—whether governmental or financial. Accordingly, adopting blockchain—especially in the customized format provided by EOSIO—becomes a strategic necessity to ensure data security, service stability, and seamless integration across various government and banking entities within a unified and reliable ecosystem.

This study is also rooted in the author’s direct experience with critical vulnerabilities in current digital platforms, emphasizing the urgency and realism of the proposed solution—not merely as a theoretical vision.

A common concern about blockchain systems is the fear of losing access to accounts due to the loss of private keys—particularly in public networks. However, this issue has been addressed in the proposed design through EOSIO’s advanced features, which allow complete concealment of private keys within the user interface, along with institutional account recovery mechanisms in cases of breach or loss. These recovery systems operate without user intervention and maintain an unchanged user experience, while remaining compliant with national identity verification and digital sovereignty standards.

## 1.3 Study Motivation

The need for this study arises from the recurring challenges faced by Saudi Arabia’s governmental and banking digital platforms. These challenges include severe cybersecurity breaches, financial embezzlement, and undetected tampering with sensitive records. Documented cases include a verified breach of the Absher platform in which official records were altered, alongside concurrent modifications in the records of a Saudi bank—indicating profound technical vulnerabilities in the existing centralized integration systems.

The severity of these incidents lies in the fact that traditional centralized systems rely on databases that allow modifications and deletions without maintaining permanent records. This enables attackers to erase evidence of breaches or make quiet alterations to data without triggering security alarms. In contrast, blockchain technology—especially through EOSIO’s architecture—offers an immutable ledger in which each transaction is permanently recorded and cannot be altered or deleted after confirmation. This ensures full transparency, continuous traceability of all operations, and makes it significantly harder to carry out or conceal illegal actions or cyberattacks.

The Saudi banking experience, along with platforms like Absher, has also shown clear shortcomings in real-time responsiveness during routine updates, with frequent service disruptions that interfere with essential transactions for both citizens and residents. These interruptions further reveal the fragility of centralized technical infrastructure and its overdependence on single points of failure.
